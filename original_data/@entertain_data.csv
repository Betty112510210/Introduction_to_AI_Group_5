"3","@MsGingerBread0216","The Barbie movie looks like my daughter's playroom. When she got to be the age to REALLY play with Barbie, she inherited ALL the Dreamhouses from my parent's attic. My mom's, my two, my sisters two, all the assorted vehicles and pools and stables and offices and salons and ice cream shoppe stands and restaurants, that had been carefully packed away from our childhoods. And then when my sister-in-law's mom downsized her house, we also got my sister-in-law's 2 dream houses, vet center, beach house, party bus, and RV camper. So basically, my kid didn't just get a dream house, she got a whole neighborhood! We ended up having to move all her other toys to the living room, because the playroom was entirely taken over by BarbieLand and also a legacy collection of Transformers. 🤣🤣🤣","2023-05-30T20:42:37Z","True"

The rotten apple is concealed   in the witch’s sleeve. Obviously, the first two judges take a good apple.  For the third judge, notice that the witch reaches into the bag, not the judge. This is when the witch drops the rotten apple from her sleeve, giving an illusion that the rotten apple was in the bag the whole time.   The witch asks Simon to choose an apple. This decision is also an illusion, for the witch doesn’t specify if Simon is choosing the good apple or the bad apple. Notice that the witch is holding the judge’s arm the entire time. This way, when the witch tells her to take a bite, the only apple the judge can take a bite from is the good apple.  Notice the witch never lets go of her cane. This is because it’s a prosthetic controlled by her real hand. This is why when the “third” hand comes out to squish the rotten apple, the arm holding the cane goes limp.

This level of stagecraft and taking relatively basic magic and dressing it all up with a story and world to live in takes a gift. To act the role so completely.

I don't know if she purposely wanted to make a huge sound like that, which may sound great for low notes but will get stuck once the notes go higher. Then Eunchae and Chaewon followed Yunjin's heaviness, and Chaewon got slightly stuck when those high notes came 1:18 (On second thought, the heaviness might have already been there starting from Chaewon's part at the very beginning, but it was Yunjin who made me realize that they sounded too heavy.)  3:03 Again, Yunjin with her heavy sound. 3:11 Then Chaewon followed and got stuck when she went high. 3:18 Still the same heaviness, was that Eunchae? 3:26 Kazuha got stuck (I hope she didn't hurt her throat. She sounded concerning here)  Did they have soundcheck before this performance? Could they hear their voices well? Was their mic too low so they felt they needed to compensate by singing louder/heavier, or was that because they just wanted to hype up the crowd? Yes, the high parts when they got stuck might be disturbing/concerning, but this was not a bad performance, imo. Might sound better if they sang lighter/less heavy than this, but I do appreciate the fact that they sang live.","2024-08-31T05:31:36Z","False"

"454","@rosieposie5852","@Momo-xp3oz After listening some more, I disagree. At least for Yunjin and Chaewon, it's clear that they can sing.  This is more like a technical issue. We can hear their voices here, but there was another fancam for the same performance and the band was so loud some people even commented that they couldn't hear their voices. The girls pushed their voices to match the loudness of the band and produced heavy sounds; not a good way to sing especially since this song got quite a lot of high notes, but I think anyone in their position would do the same thing. If they did sing lighter, the sound of the band would have eaten their voices up, and people like you would have bashed them even more.  They had also performed this song before, without the band, the music was not loud like this, and they did sing lighter. If any, I want to praise the girls because they have good ears, they can adjust their voices to match the volume of the band/music. The one that needed to be adjusted/increased for this Coachella performance was their mics' volume, imo. Or use lighter music/instrumentals.","2024-09-03T13:58:59Z","True"
"455","@satoruswift1989","Another factor could also be that they’re tired — Yunjin’s part doesn’t usually sound that deep so I suspected that as soon as I heard it. However, what HYBE should’ve really done was to train the girls vocally and stamina for a longer period of time knowing they’d perform at Coachella.","2024-09-13T14:28:52Z","True"
"456","@rosieposie5852","​@@satoruswift1989Yes, they must be tired. If we are talking about stamina, Eunchae was the one lacking, from what I can hear. Both Eunchae and Yunjin pushed their voices, both sounded noticably heavy, but Yunjin could hold her notes and still sounded glorious, while Eunchae didn't have the breath support that Yunjin had. Chaewon was fine. I'm not sure about Kazuha, she sounded weak. I don't know whether it was her placement, her stamina, or something else. But I sense that she, Eunchae, and Sakura have the potential to do much better with proper training.  You sound like their fan, so you must know better than me. A channel I follow talked about how Sakura was trained. I don't really remember, was it from a documentary? They only told Sakura to sing confidently. No proper training. I don't know whether that person was their vocal coach, their producer, or someone else, but they acted more like a therapist than a vocal coach and they were clearly incompetent. If this was how the girls were trained vocally, I understand why the girls, especially Sakura, sounded like that. Their companies gotta find them a real vocal coach first before anything else.","2024-09-25T20:11:28Z","True"
"457","@satoruswift1989","@@rosieposie5852 I have been following them since their ANTIFRAGILE era, so maybe I’m a fearnot. Sakura has been a self-trained singer for the past few years ever since her time as an idol in Japan before Produce 48. Generally, idols in Japan train by themselves to sing because their motive on stage was to make sure fans were satisfied and entertained with the performance, and overall not about skill. However, Korea has higher standards and by the time Sakura was in Korea, she was already 20. She suffered from inferiority complex due to how different the systems are in Korea than Japan. HYBE isn’t known for its vocal training, and they’re quite horrible at that field.   What I think would improve Sakura would be some confidence since in Coachella she never sounded like she was insecure on stage, she was very confident. Maybe a song that would fit her tone, too. I’ve noticed that HYBE has a habit of making their idols sing out of their range (e.g ILLIT)  I don’t even think Eunchae is ready to be an idol, or even, to debut. She lacks the stage presence of an idol and sometimes, you wouldn’t even notice her on stage because of that. Her dancing and singing skills are lacking, but if HYBE was a better company, they would’ve solved that problem. Hopefully the girls would continue to improve.","2024-09-25T20:22:50Z","True"

The end throws me off tho, she really doesnt have a good control of her vocals, its all over the place   personally i dont think anyone in le sserafim is a good live vocal singer... if you compare them to eachother then chaewon was the best i guess ( 3:9 ??? 0:50 ??) imma js put this out there that if u compare these girls to RIIZE, BABYMONSTER, AESPA or NMIXX there is SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! seriously, you guys are only saying this because you like them as persons and not as singers, just because you like their personality and not their vocals....","2024-08-28T16:18:46Z","True"

When first listening to it, Cynthia was uncharacteristically really pitchy and had timing issues during Defying Gravity, which makes me think there were problems with her in-ear monitor (because she's such an amazing musician and isn't a stranger to performing live). You can still kind of hear the tempo conflicts when Ariana comes in with ""if we work in tandem;"" it sounds like she's early even though she's actually on-beat. That being said, I love both of them as artists and the performance has been produced really well so it sounds natural and makes it one I listen to on repeat.","2025-05-04T03:09:35Z","False"

The tricks she had would immediately be shadowed by something Nymphia was just CASUALLY pulling out. Every step for Nymphia was a leap for Sapphira.   Key moments I am talking about is;  Sapphira showing stress and rushing her reveal to keep up with the stage hype caused by Nymphias STRONG beginning. Sapphiras SMOOTH split upstaged by Nymphias flawless reveal. Sapphiras comedy moves during ""Whats underneath that t-shirt"" followed by Nymphias whimsical handstand against the wall into a split Nymphia capturing the audiences eyes with her moving to each side of the stage to engage away from Sapphiras boob bouncing Nymphia cutely approaching the other cast members and engaging with them while Sapphira aggresively kicks after a wig reveal.(This might be Nymphia unknowingly letting Sapphira catch a break... It worked for a moment! Follow Ru's eyes) Sapphira sliding into a split followed by a graceful asf heel stomp split by Nymphia to close.   Both did amazing but...

The scene where their child passes… I couldn’t hold back my tears. As someone who has experienced that unbearable loss, this wasn’t just emotional—it was personal. The pain, the emptiness, the unanswered questions—it was all portrayed with such delicate honesty.  Thank you to the creators for honoring such deep emotions with grace and truth. This drama reminded me that grief is not weakness… it’s love with nowhere to go. I pray for every parent who has held their child only to say goodbye too soon. You are not alone. 💔🕊","2025-04-11T18:29:14Z","False"

"1831","@dominican7155","This drama is a masterpiece, emphasizing what truly matters in life—unconditional love. Unlike other dramas that portray wealth and material success as the key to overcoming hardship, this story reveals a deeper purpose. Watching it, I am inspired to be like Gwan-sik for my family—to love and provide for them so they can rest, even if only for a little while. In death, we finally sleep, but there is beauty in having loved ones worth sacrificing for. That is a life truly worth living.  Spoilers ahead  Together they lived a wonderful life and achieved things people only dream of - had a family, owned a home, a boat, sent their daughter to the best uni in the country, sent her abroad, opened up their own restaurant, provided for their son and grandchildren.","2025-03-29T23:22:55Z","False"
"1832","@Yuxin-cc7","I couldn't agree more with you that unconditional love is what really matters in life. The story of three generations of women in this drama emphasizes a mother's unwavering love for her child. In order to prevent Ae-sun from becoming a sea maiden, her mother, Gwang-rye, worked till the end of her life. She wanted Ae-sun to be allowed to follow her ambition of becoming a poet. Despite becoming a housewife, Ae-sun sacrificed everything for her daughter Geum-myeong to be able to attend college and study overseas. In addition to that, Gwan-sik has given his all to the family as a husband and a father. As a husband, he supports his wife unconditionally and gives her love and care. As a father, he supported his family by doing dangerous fishing work and sold his house to give his daughter a better education. Although he worked hard throughout his life and only lived to be 56, his death was tragic for many people since they believed he should have had a comfortable and happy old age. We all sleep long, but having loved ones worth dying for is something that makes life worth living.","2025-04-08T07:50:51Z","True"

The storyline is expertly woven, showcasing the most beautiful aspects of human relationships.  At its core, this drama is a poignant portrayal of true love. The way the characters' emotions are explored, the depth of their feelings, and the sacrifices they make for each other are all truly captivating.  What's more, the drama highlights the importance of mutual respect in relationships. The characters' interactions are laced with empathy, understanding, and a deep appreciation for one another.  The parental love depicted in the drama is also noteworthy. The sacrifices that the parents make for their children, the unconditional support they provide, and the wisdom they impart are all heartwarming.

I cried a lot today, and now I just want to express all this through writing. No matter what you're going through, make sure to watch this series. I feel so empty today, yet it feels so fulfilling inside. I want to say thank you to every character, every team member. I've never seen anything like this before. I forgot it was just a show; I forgot these were characters…  Thank you.  I've seen a lot in life—sorrow and joy—but I have no regrets. I'm 25 years old now, and someday when I'm 50 or 60, sitting with my wife, I'll remember these moments. I just want to live—with happiness or pain, whatever it brings. I want to live my whole life, see all its ups and downs. Even if I can't give my parents happiness through money, I will surely give them love. My father is everything to me—he has worked so hard. I will stay with him. I have no complaints about my parents—only gratitude. I’m happy.  I love you, Mom and Dad. I may never be able to express it openly, but I am yours—I exist because of you. Please forgive all my mistakes, and stay happy.  Maybe I’ve written a bit too much, but if someone is still reading this—thank you. Keep your parents happy. And love your husband or wife with all your heart. Live life fully. Don't hold on to complaints or grudges…  Thank you. – Nikhil 🤍","2025-05-11T19:43:26Z","False"

 Some people have asked, “Are all the grandmothers so rough in the way they speak?” But if you take a closer look at their lives, you’ll understand why.  
 Someone once described *haenyeo* as the strongest mothers in the world.  
 If you also take into account the history of Jeju Island and what’s mentioned above, you’ll enjoy the drama even more. For reference, according to what I heard directly from a haenyeo, sumbi sori may sound beautiful, but to them, it is the sound of life—released after holding their breath for a long time.","2025-03-22T06:09:01Z","False"
