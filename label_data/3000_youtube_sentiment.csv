Also,  add a tablespoon when it’s sticky, don’t add too much just add untill it looks like the one in the video.  -Granulated Sugar: 5tbsp, 2tsp, and 1/4tsp -Salt: 1tsp, and 1/4tsp -Instant dry yeast: 1tsp, and 1/4tsp  2egg + Milk: 3/4 cup  (assuming eggs are 45g I’d suggest using a weighing scale through all the ingredients but if you don’t have one these measurements will do!)  -unsalted butter: 3tbsp, 1tsp, and 1/4tsp   CUSTARD  -3eggs -Cane Sugar: 3tbsp, and 1tsp -Cake Flour: 2tbsp,  and 1/4tbsp -Milk: 1cup and 4tbsp -Vanila Bean: 1/3  also it’s highly recommended to use vanilla bean but if you don’t have one you can use 1tsp of vanilla extract, and add the extract after it thickens.

Being able to save money was not really feasible until later in life.  I did buy a home at 27 with a rental unit.  The home investment (it was a dump) took most of my spare money for a decade.  But it’s a tangible assset.  Now at 54 I’m in a spot where I could live frugally and retire right now.  But that whole thing was a process to get to.  I’ll be retiring at 56.,2024-11-02T03:15:55Z,False,positive

The story of three generations of women in this drama emphasizes a mother's unwavering love for her child. In order to prevent Ae-sun from becoming a sea maiden, her mother, Gwang-rye, worked till the end of her life. She wanted Ae-sun to be allowed to follow her ambition of becoming a poet. Despite becoming a housewife, Ae-sun sacrificed everything for her daughter Geum-myeong to be able to attend college and study overseas. In addition to that, Gwan-sik has given his all to the family as a husband and a father. As a husband, he supports his wife unconditionally and gives her love and care. As a father, he supported his family by doing dangerous fishing work and sold his house to give his daughter a better education. Although he worked hard throughout his life and only lived to be 56, his death was tragic for many people since they believed he should have had a comfortable and happy old age.

And then when my sister-in-law's mom downsized her house, we also got my sister-in-law's 2 dream houses, vet center, beach house, party bus, and RV camper.

Oh well, error's on me, next time I'll leave them for longer. More importantly, it tastes very good !! I couldn't do the fillings because I didn't have the ingredient, but even the simple donuts coated in sugar taste good, and one is enough to fill your stomach.

Then I pictured myself as the adult, and saw that the adult me was more calm and collected and comfortable in practicing this. What I did was not force the child to participate, but allow her to watch on the side, and in doing so I demonstrated to her that this state/activity is not dangerous. I believe that as she starts to feel more at ease with this activity in the future, her natural curiosity will come back and we can explore this exercise together, one step at a time :) Thank you for making this video!",2024-11-11T09:37:23Z,False,positive

I never cry, but today I did—because this story teaches us so much about life, love, friendship, and the love of parents in such a short time. I've been away from home for quite a while, but tomorrow I'm going back to be with my mom and dad. I want to see them, talk to them. I cried a lot today, and now I just want to express all this through writing. No matter what you're going through, make sure to watch this series. I feel so empty today, yet it feels so fulfilling inside. I want to say thank you to every character, every team member. I've never seen anything like this before. I forgot it was just a show; I forgot these were characters…  Thank you.  I've seen a lot in life—sorrow and joy—but I have no regrets. I'm 25 years old now, and someday when I'm 50 or 60, sitting with my wife, I'll remember these moments. I just want to live—with happiness or pain, whatever it brings. I want to live my whole life, see all its ups and downs. Even if I can't give my parents happiness through money, I will surely give them love. My father is everything to me—he has worked so hard. I will stay with him. I have no complaints about my parents—only gratitude. I’m happy.  I love you, Mom and Dad. I may never be able to express it openly, but I am yours—I exist because of you. Please forgive all my mistakes, and stay happy.  Maybe I’ve written a bit too much, but if someone is still reading this—thank you. Keep your parents happy. And love your husband or wife with all your heart. Live life fully. Don't hold on to complaints or grudges…  Thank you. – Nikhil 🤍",2025-05-11T19:43:26Z,False,positive

1287,@swiftheart27,"I used to be depressed and extremely stressed when I was younger due to homework, exams and other things in life. I started to jog to see if that would change anything, and honestly, it helped me out quite an amount until I stopped after I got better (and lazy/lesser time to jog around.) I still am stressed from assignments now, but I can cope a little better. :)  Edit: wow, it’s been 2 years and I just happened to receive a notif to this comment.  TLDR: Things are better now compared with before in some aspects. Confidence and self-love went up, haven’t exercised as much, and will be going to soon. Not exercising, makes me feel so sluggish. It’s not bad, but I miss the times where I was more motivated and active, really. I hope everyone figures out a way to destress. Going out on a walk and being out in nature is nice. Go to the park and walk, take in the fresh air. It’s good for you, truly. Doesn’t make you feel boxed in or trapped, in my experience.   I’ve been doing much better than I was when I was younger. Two years ago, I was more emotional and erratic with how I reacted, etc. I worked out at a gym for a few months until covid hit, and the gyms were closed because of it. I tried to maintain my diet/macros/calories and worked out at home, but with classes and my lack of motivation/preference to work out at the gym, I soon stopped. Fortunately, once the gyms were back, I immediately went back- but to my demise, my pt was switched because the gym didn’t pay him as much due to covid and so he left. During covid, I became more self-aware and realised I had gastric/stomach issues, even up till today, I still have acid reflux, heart burns, etc etc. it was worse during covid but it’s much better now. I’m still learning to take care of myself, but I have been wanting to get back into working out. I feel so sluggish after not working out for so long, even after my trail at the gym was completed, I tried to maintain but I wasn’t/am not as motivated as I was two years ago. I was so keen and active back then, but now I’ve accepted myself for who and what I am, and yet, I still feel pressured by my family and myself- to get back to being healthier. And I do want to, but it is very easily for me to lose motivation if I excessively start off strong or burn out too quickly from so much effort. This time, I’m trying to start slow and build it up with consistency; something I’ve never truly had for long periods of time. I recommend going out, have some peace-walks/walks without using your phone all the time (but keep it there in case of emergencies, idk, up to you,) and just take in deep breaths, and remind yourself that a lot of the times, our problems are short-term and temporary and we can always get through it, somehow. It’ll be in the past at some point, so don’t push yourself too hard and be sure to take a break from work or studies every now and then. I should do the same too. :) thanks",2020-11-02T09:13:07Z,False,neutral

I was wondering why my husband rarely cries while cutting onions - and then I realized, that he's tall and has long hands while I'm short with short hands and also short-sighted, always leaning close to what I'm doing (if not wearing glasses).  I tried to stand straight,  stretch my hands, keep my face as far as possible from the onion - and it made a huge difference.   But having a sharp knife, as somebody mentioned above, is important too.  Also, two onions, each from a different source but looking the same, can have different potency, some have only slight onion taste, I would probably be able to eat them like apples, and some are very ""onionish"".  When I come to think about it, some 15 years ago all onions were very ""strong"", but nowadays it's rare to come across a strong one, most of those I buy are almost bland and don't make me cry even if I stick my face close to them.

If you live here then you can get 40% off on train transportation. Not to other countries though. You need to pay a small amount a month to do so.  Plane tickets from Amsterdam are also very cheap to the rest of Europe. They can be way cheaper than train even if you look for them off season. I traveled once to Hungary and back for 34 euro's with hand luggage in September. Schiphol is one of Europe's best connected and busiest airport.

Sakura has been a self-trained singer for the past few years ever since her time as an idol in Japan before Produce 48. Generally, idols in Japan train by themselves to sing because their motive on stage was to make sure fans were satisfied and entertained with the performance, and overall not about skill. However, Korea has higher standards and by the time Sakura was in Korea, she was already 20. She suffered from inferiority complex due to how different the systems are in Korea than Japan. HYBE isn’t known for its vocal training, and they’re quite horrible at that field.   What I think would improve Sakura would be some confidence since in Coachella she never sounded like she was insecure on stage, she was very confident. Maybe a song that would fit her tone, too. I’ve noticed that HYBE has a habit of making their idols sing out of their range (e.g ILLIT)  I don’t even think Eunchae is ready to be an idol, or even, to debut. She lacks the stage presence of an idol and sometimes, you wouldn’t even notice her on stage because of that. Her dancing and singing skills are lacking, but if HYBE was a better company, they would’ve solved that problem. Hopefully the girls would continue to improve.",2024-09-25T20:22:50Z,True,negative

According to reports, the attackers used brutal methods such as checking for circumcision to identify non-Muslim men. Tragically, a local Muslim pony ride operator who attempted to protect the tourists was also killed by the terrorists, highlighting the indiscriminate and extremist nature of such violence. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, was found hiding in Abbottabad, Pakistan, near a military facility—raising serious concerns about official complicity. Pakistan has previously been placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ""grey list"" for failing to adequately combat terrorism financing. Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, confessed that he had been trained and funded by elements linked to Pakistan. Over the years, numerous terrorist attacks have shown evidence of cross-border involvement. In response, India conducted targeted counter-terrorism operations against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan—not against civilian areas—aiming specifically at camps used by terror groups.  Shockingly, terrorists eliminated in these Indian airstrikes were later given a guard of honour at funerals attended by senior Pakistan Army officers and a UN-designated terrorist. Some of those figures were also linked to the brutal murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, further highlighting the deep-rooted connections between militant groups and state actors.  Following India’s precision strikes, Pakistan launched missile attacks on Indian territory. However, India successfully intercepted these attempts and swiftly retaliated. Unlike India, Pakistan was unable to intercept the Indian response, resulting in successful hits on its soil. Subsequently, Pakistan attempted to play the victim card on international platforms, despite initiating retaliation after housing and honouring known terrorists.",2025-05-10T11:56:32Z,False,negative

He also took down crosses to not offend Muslims for their meeting. I don't see Muslims putting up crosses in meetings with Christian's, so it should be the same. We should never sacrifice our faith just to not ""offend"" anyone. He was also famous for bringing a native American idoltry statue into the church during lent, which is creating false idols and worshipping a false God. Not to speak ill of the dead, but he was not a very good Pope, take it from a Catholic, who has read and studied hundreds of hours of the Bible, Christianity and Islam, he did not have our best interests at heart and was more preoccupied with being progressive and trying to change what wasn't broken.

I don't know whether that person was their vocal coach, their producer, or someone else, but they acted more like a therapist than a vocal coach and they were clearly incompetent.

452,@rosieposie5852,"Their voices were heavy, heavier than what they should sound. I'm not really familiar with their voices, but starting from 1:04, Yunjin sounded sooo heavy in my ears. I don't know if she purposely wanted to make a huge sound like that, which may sound great for low notes but will get stuck once the notes go higher. Then Eunchae and Chaewon followed Yunjin's heaviness, and Chaewon got slightly stuck when those high notes came 1:18 (On second thought, the heaviness might have already been there starting from Chaewon's part at the very beginning, but it was Yunjin who made me realize that they sounded too heavy.)  3:03 Again, Yunjin with her heavy sound. 3:11 Then Chaewon followed and got stuck when she went high. 3:18 Still the same heaviness, was that Eunchae? 3:26 Kazuha got stuck (I hope she didn't hurt her throat. She sounded concerning here)  Did they have soundcheck before this performance? Could they hear their voices well? Was their mic too low so they felt they needed to compensate by singing louder/heavier, or was that because they just wanted to hype up the crowd? Yes, the high parts when they got stuck might be disturbing/concerning, but this was not a bad performance, imo. Might sound better if they sang lighter/less heavy than this, but I do appreciate the fact that they sang live.",2024-08-31T05:31:36Z,False,negative
