Without an actual name people were either actually calling it Coronavirus as Its name, not a placeholder, or nicknaming it the China virus.  It seems harmless enough but in the first case, people were associating Coronaviruses (the group not the covid-19) with the Coronavirus and causing confusion/misinformation. Both of which are dangerous during a time of an epidemic and possible pandemic.  The bigger one imo, is the latter case where people were calling this the China virus or anything of the like that puts China or Asia in the title. This sparked issues of racism as Asians (not even just ethnically Chinese) started being discriminated against within their countries despite having never been to China, much less Wuhan. The likelihood of them having the disease is about the same as anyone else in their country yet because of the way they look and the nickname of the virus, would treat them poorly. I have a friend from the Philippines (has no Chinese family and has never been to China) who said that she was eating and talking on the phone while sitting on a park bench. The food went down the wrong throat so she coughed. As a result, the people walking by her stared at her in horror and lifted up their shirts to cover their mouths/noses while moving past.  So while it seems like it's not a big deal that they finally gave this a name, it somewhat is. In fact I wish they did it sooner.",2020-02-12T13:56:55Z,TRUE,negative

According to reports, the attackers used brutal methods such as checking for circumcision to identify non-Muslim men. Tragically, a local Muslim pony ride operator who attempted to protect the tourists was also killed by the terrorists, highlighting the indiscriminate and extremist nature of such violence. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, was found hiding in Abbottabad, Pakistan, near a military facility‚Äîraising serious concerns about official complicity. Pakistan has previously been placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ""grey list"" for failing to adequately combat terrorism financing. Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, confessed that he had been trained and funded by elements linked to Pakistan. Over the years, numerous terrorist attacks have shown evidence of cross-border involvement. In response, India conducted targeted counter-terrorism operations against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan‚Äînot against civilian areas‚Äîaiming specifically at camps used by terror groups.  Shockingly, terrorists eliminated in these Indian airstrikes were later given a guard of honour at funerals attended by senior Pakistan Army officers and a UN-designated terrorist. Some of those figures were also linked to the brutal murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, further highlighting the deep-rooted connections between militant groups and state actors.  Following India‚Äôs precision strikes, Pakistan launched missile attacks on Indian territory. However, India successfully intercepted these attempts and swiftly retaliated. Unlike India, Pakistan was unable to intercept the Indian response, resulting in successful hits on its soil. Subsequently, Pakistan attempted to play the victim card on international platforms, despite initiating retaliation after housing and honouring known terrorists.",2025-05-10T11:56:32Z,FALSE,negative

He also took down crosses to not offend Muslims for their meeting. I don't see Muslims putting up crosses in meetings with Christian's, so it should be the same. We should never sacrifice our faith just to not ""offend"" anyone. He was also famous for bringing a native American idoltry statue into the church during lent, which is creating false idols and worshipping a false God. Not to speak ill of the dead, but he was not a very good Pope, take it from a Catholic, who has read and studied hundreds of hours of the Bible, Christianity and Islam, he did not have our best interests at heart and was more preoccupied with being progressive and trying to change what wasn't broken. He was corrupt and before giving him credit, people like you should do your research first.

1794,@Don_Orotelli,"@@fudgeknights Jesus Christ said: ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."" - Matthew 10:34 (NIV) Meaning that he wasn't here to not ""offend"" anyone and to ""be respectful to all religions"", absolutely not, he called the Jewish synagogue's, the ""synagogue of Satan"", which was one of the reasons God sent him down, was to correct what was broken and lost. Which included occasionally offending the Rabbi's. The Bible also says:""But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let them be under God‚Äôs curse!"" - Galatians 1:8 (NIV) Which is something that Islam does, takes away important things from the Bible and twists the narrative with an Arab agenda. Of which their prophet, should by no means be respected, when he had 12 wives, including a 6 year old girl, he started 83 wars in 10 years, and was an overall war monger, who killed hundreds of people. We should not be respecting this, and especially when his violent teachings are still affecting Jews and Christians till this day in the middle east and Africa.  ""I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from them their share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll."" - Revelation 22:18-19 (NIV)",2025-04-22T10:45:39Z,TRUE,negative
