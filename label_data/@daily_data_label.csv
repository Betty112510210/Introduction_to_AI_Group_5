What I did was not force the child to participate, but allow her to watch on the side, and in doing so I demonstrated to her that this state/activity is not dangerous.

364,@SkyBlueDesign1,"The tip for not crying while cutting onions: don't lean too close over them.  I was wondering why my husband rarely cries while cutting onions - and then I realized, that he's tall and has long hands while I'm short with short hands and also short-sighted, always leaning close to what I'm doing (if not wearing glasses).  I tried to stand straight,  stretch my hands, keep my face as far as possible from the onion - and it made a huge difference.   But having a sharp knife, as somebody mentioned above, is important too.  Also, two onions, each from a different source but looking the same, can have different potency, some have only slight onion taste, I would probably be able to eat them like apples, and some are very ""onionish"".  When I come to think about it, some 15 years ago all onions were very ""strong"", but nowadays it's rare to come across a strong one, most of those I buy are almost bland and don't make me cry even if I stick my face close to them.

Further, if we already understand that we are pulling a muscle, we need to realize that only a nerve impulse sets the muscle in motion and it does not matter if it is a contraction or stretching..  And hence the logical conclusion follows➡️  Why sit for minutes in static, if there is no sense from it?

My favourite stretching poses are pigeon pose, mermaid pose (or pigeon+grab on a stiffer day), supine spinal twist and deep glute stretch. I think they’re all pretty basic but it happens often that a stretching video I chose for the day doesn’t include all four of them so I have to take extra time to add the left out poses myself. I’m glad that this video include all of my favourite poses!

After adding to the egg liquid in (1) and mixing until homogeneous, return to the pot and cook the custard over medium heat.   3. Strain the custard cream with a net to remove the vanilla pods, apply a tight wrap and apply to ice water to remove the coarse heat.   4. Make chocolate custard cream. Finely chop 50g of sweet chocolate. Beat 3 egg yolks, add 45 g of granulated sugar and mix until whitish and thick. Add 16g of plain flour and mix until the powderiness disappears.   5. Put 250ml of milk in a small saucepan, warm it until it does not boil, add the egg liquid in (1) and mix until homogeneous, then return to the pot and cook the custard over medium heat.   6. Add 50 g of chopped sweet chocolate to melt the chocolate and strain the custard cream through a net. Apply adhesive wrap and apply to ice water to remove coarse heat, and when cool, cool in the refrigerator.   7. Mix in a bowl with 350g of strong flour, 150g of plain flour, 70g of granulated sugar, 6g of salt and 6g of instant dry yeast.   8. Add milk to 2 whole eggs, weigh 285g, mix, add to flour and mix. When mixed, put it on a large cutting board and knead until smooth.   9. Add 45g of unsalted butter brought to room temperature and knead until the butter blends. Roll it neatly, put it back in a bowl, wrap it, and let it ferment for about 1 hour until it doubles in size.   10. After fermenting, degasse and divide into 12 equal portions (74-75g), roll lightly and allow 15-20 minutes of bench time.   11. Degassing the dough, shape it into a circle so that the middle is flat, cover with plastic wrap and leave to ferment for 45-60 minutes.   12. Remove the plastic wrap and dry the surface for about 10 minutes. If the dough does not stick even if you stroke it gently with your fingers, fry it in frying oil warmed to 170°C for 2 minutes at a time (4 minutes in total).   13. While the oil is drained and warm, pierce the dough and sprinkle it with granulated sugar (chocolate custard is a mixture of 30 g of granulated sugar and 8 g of cocoa powder).   14.

Fo the frying part, I think my oil was too hot : the outside and a small part of the inside cooked fairly quickly, but the ""core"" of the donut was uncooked. Oh well, error's on me, next time I'll leave them for longer. More importantly, it tastes very good !! I couldn't do the fillings because I didn't have the ingredient, but even the simple donuts coated in sugar taste good, and one is enough to fill your stomach.

Trust me, you will feel refreshed when you wake up. 2. Prioritize. Do things first which needs your attention the most. 3. Do not multitask. Our brains aren't designed to multitask, so stop doing it already and focus your attention on one work at one time. You'll perform much better this way. 4. Be a little conscientious. Try to keep your room tidy and things arranged properly. 5. Have a list of daily achievable goals and try to get those completed on the same day. 6. Keep away from social media as much as you can. Social media is like junk food for your brain. 7. Be thankful for what you have.

Ever since I entered this stressful phase in my life, I saw various physical and mental functionalities. For starters, I lost *so* much hair. I probably have 1/10 the hair I used to have. I developed IBS and ulcers. My face looks aged/tired. Mentally, I'm much worse; I get panic attacks for the simplest, stupidest reasons. I'm rarely happy. I forget everything, my long term/ short term memory is shit. I can hardly sleep at night. I get headaches often.  With all these negative effects, I feel as though I would have damaged my body much less had I smoked weed or cigarettes. As horrible as smoking is, I feel that it would have alleviated stress, and whatever damage smoking would have caused would't be anywhere near as bad as what stress has caused. I hate myself for having done so much irreparable damage to my body.

I started to jog to see if that would change anything, and honestly, it helped me out quite an amount until I stopped after I got better (and lazy/lesser time to jog around.) I still am stressed from assignments now, but I can cope a little better. :)  Edit: wow, it’s been 2 years and I just happened to receive a notif to this comment.  TLDR: Things are better now compared with before in some aspects. Confidence and self-love went up, haven’t exercised as much, and will be going to soon. Not exercising, makes me feel so sluggish. It’s not bad, but I miss the times where I was more motivated and active, really. I hope everyone figures out a way to destress. Going out on a walk and being out in nature is nice. Go to the park and walk, take in the fresh air. It’s good for you, truly. Doesn’t make you feel boxed in or trapped, in my experience.   I’ve been doing much better than I was when I was younger. Two years ago, I was more emotional and erratic with how I reacted, etc. I worked out at a gym for a few months until covid hit, and the gyms were closed because of it. I tried to maintain my diet/macros/calories and worked out at home, but with classes and my lack of motivation/preference to work out at the gym, I soon stopped. Fortunately, once the gyms were back, I immediately went back- but to my demise, my pt was switched because the gym didn’t pay him as much due to covid and so he left. During covid, I became more self-aware and realised I had gastric/stomach issues, even up till today, I still have acid reflux, heart burns, etc etc. it was worse during covid but it’s much better now. I’m still learning to take care of myself, but I have been wanting to get back into working out. I feel so sluggish after not working out for so long, even after my trail at the gym was completed, I tried to maintain but I wasn’t/am not as motivated as I was two years ago. I was so keen and active back then, but now I’ve accepted myself for who and what I am, and yet, I still feel pressured by my family and myself- to get back to being healthier. And I do want to, but it is very easily for me to lose motivation if I excessively start off strong or burn out too quickly from so much effort. This time, I’m trying to start slow and build it up with consistency; something I’ve never truly had for long periods of time. I recommend going out, have some peace-walks/walks without using your phone all the time (but keep it there in case of emergencies, idk, up to you,) and just take in deep breaths, and remind yourself that a lot of the times, our problems are short-term and temporary and we can always get through it, somehow. It’ll be in the past at some point, so don’t push yourself too hard and be sure to take a break from work or studies every now and then. I should do the same too. :) thanks",2020-11-02T09:13:07Z,False,neutral
