According to reports, the attackers used brutal methods such as checking for circumcision to identify non-Muslim men. Tragically, a local Muslim pony ride operator who attempted to protect the tourists was also killed by the terrorists, highlighting the indiscriminate and extremist nature of such violence. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, was found hiding in Abbottabad, Pakistan, near a military facility—raising serious concerns about official complicity. Pakistan has previously been placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ""grey list"" for failing to adequately combat terrorism financing. Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, confessed that he had been trained and funded by elements linked to Pakistan. Over the years, numerous terrorist attacks have shown evidence of cross-border involvement. In response, India conducted targeted counter-terrorism operations against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan—not against civilian areas—aiming specifically at camps used by terror groups.  Shockingly, terrorists eliminated in these Indian airstrikes were later given a guard of honour at funerals attended by senior Pakistan Army officers and a UN-designated terrorist. Some of those figures were also linked to the brutal murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, further highlighting the deep-rooted connections between militant groups and state actors.  Following India’s precision strikes, Pakistan launched missile attacks on Indian territory. However, India successfully intercepted these attempts and swiftly retaliated. Unlike India, Pakistan was unable to intercept the Indian response, resulting in successful hits on its soil. Subsequently, Pakistan attempted to play the victim card on international platforms, despite initiating retaliation after housing and honouring known terrorists.",2025-05-10T11:56:32Z,FALSE,negative,不會,會,不會,,相同

457,@satoruswift1989,"@@rosieposie5852 I have been following them since their ANTIFRAGILE era, so maybe I’m a fearnot. Sakura has been a self-trained singer for the past few years ever since her time as an idol in Japan before Produce 48. Generally, idols in Japan train by themselves to sing because their motive on stage was to make sure fans were satisfied and entertained with the performance, and overall not about skill. However, Korea has higher standards and by the time Sakura was in Korea, she was already 20. She suffered from inferiority complex due to how different the systems are in Korea than Japan. HYBE isn’t known for its vocal training, and they’re quite horrible at that field.   What I think would improve Sakura would be some confidence since in Coachella she never sounded like she was insecure on stage, she was very confident. Maybe a song that would fit her tone, too. I’ve noticed that HYBE has a habit of making their idols sing out of their range (e.g ILLIT)  I don’t even think Eunchae is ready to be an idol, or even, to debut. She lacks the stage presence of an idol and sometimes, you wouldn’t even notice her on stage because of that. Her dancing and singing skills are lacking, but if HYBE was a better company, they would’ve solved that problem. Hopefully the girls would continue to improve.",2024-09-25T20:22:50Z,TRUE,negative,會,不會,不會,,不同
